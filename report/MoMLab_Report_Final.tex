\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{C}{ylindrical} pressure vessels are an effective way to store gasses or liquids which must be kept at certain high pressures.
As such, knowing the operating and current pressures in these vessels is imperative to ensuring user safety; catastrophic failures in these vessels can sometimes be fatal.
The stresses in the walls of these vessels can be used to determine the overall pressure within the vessel.
This study seeks the pressure in a sealed soda can.

The can is a thin-walled pressure vessel.
The diameter of the can is much greater than its wall thickness, leading to the assumption that there is no stress in the direction of the thickness of the can, so the stresses in the vessel wall can be analyzed as a two-dimensional stress state, the plane stress condition.

To analyze this stress state, strain gauges can be affixed in a 0-45-90$^\circ$ rosette on the side of the can to record the strains on the walls.
Using multiple strain gauges allows an experimenter to determine the complete strain state, including the shear strain.
As the strain gauge is a transducer, the strains are recorded as a voltage difference, $\Delta V_{g}$, and are calculated according to \eqref{eq:strain}, where $V_s$ is the excitation voltage for the circuit, $G_f$ is the gauge factor of the strain gauge, given by the manufacturer, and $A$ is the gain of the amplifier.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:strain}
\varepsilon=\frac{4\Delta V_g}{A V_s G_f}
\end{equation}

These strain gauges work in conjunction with a quarter Wheatstone bridge circuit to record meaningful voltage differences (Fig. \ref{fig:Wheat}).
The strain gauge acts as a variable resistor.
The change in voltage across the bridge as the strain gauge moves and varies its resistance is the voltage used to compute strain in \eqref{eq:strain}.
Each member of the strain gauge rosette has its own individual Wheatstone bridge circuit fed by an excitation voltage.

\label{fig:Wheat}
\caption{A simple quarter Wheatstone bridge circuit.}
\end{figure}

In plane strain, the shear strain $\gamma_{xy}$ can be computed using the 45$^\circ$ strain gauge value according to \eqref{eq:strainThet}, where $\varepsilon_x$ and $\varepsilon_y$ are the strains from the 0$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$ strain gauges, and $\theta$ is 45$^\circ$ for this rosette \cite{b5}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:strainThet}
\varepsilon_\theta=\frac{\varepsilon_x+\varepsilon_y}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon_x-\varepsilon_y}{2}\cos(2\theta)+\gamma_{xy}\sin(2\theta)
\end{equation}

While the experimenter should attempt to align the strain gauge rosette along the principal axes, along the can's central axis and along its circumference, the true principal strain should be found according to \eqref{eq:princStrain}, where $\varepsilon_{1,2}$ are the principal strains for the plane strain condition.
This is based upon the concepts of Mohr’s circle, a geometric way to identify principal stresses and strains in a material.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:princStrain}
\varepsilon_{1,2}=\frac{\varepsilon_x+\varepsilon_y}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\varepsilon_x-\varepsilon_y}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2}\right)^2}
\end{equation}

With principal strains in hand, the principal stresses in the vessel can thus be computed.
These principal stresses in the wall arise from the internal pressure pushing on the can wall, so knowing the principal stresses in the wall may lead to the pressure within the can.
In 2D strain, the well-known Hooke’s law relating stress to strain is given directionally as \eqref{eq:sigma1} and \eqref{eq:sigma2}, where $\sigma_{1,2}$ are the principal stress on the wall, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity for the can material, aluminum alloy, $\nu$ is Poisson’s ratio, and $\varepsilon_{1,2}$ are the principal strains, found by using \eqref{eq:princStrain} with the recorded strains \cite{b1}.
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:sigmas}
\begin{align}
\sigma_1&=\frac{E}{1-\nu^2}\left(\varepsilon_1+\nu\varepsilon_2\right) \label{eq:sigma1} \\
\sigma_2&=\frac{E}{1-\nu^2}\left(\varepsilon_2+\nu\varepsilon_1\right) \label{eq:sigma2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
For thin-walled pressure vessels, the 2D stress state is described by the longitudinal stress, along the vessel's central axis, and hoop stress, along its circumference, which can be computed with the principal strains above.
The free-body diagram (Fig. \ref{fig:PVessel}) can be a helpful tool in relating these stresses to the can's internal pressure \cite{b1}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{PVessel}
\caption{Free-body diagram of the pressures acting on the pressure vessel internally.}
\label{fig:PVessel}
\end{figure}

The force balance for this diagram is \eqref{eq:vesselForce},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vesselForce}
(2rL)P=(2Lt)\sigma_H
\end{equation}
as pressure $P$ acts on the can inner surface area, $2rL$, and is resisted by the circumferential stress $\sigma_H$ acting on wall area $2Lt$.
The expression \eqref{eq:vesselForce} can be solved for the hoop stress $\sigma_H$ as \eqref{eq:hoopStress}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hoopStress}
\sigma_H=\frac{Pr}{t}
\end{equation}

This hoop stress is related to its orthogonal longitudinal stress $\sigma_L$ with relationship \eqref{eq:longStress}, known from thin-walled pressure vessel theory \cite{b1}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:longStress}
\sigma_L=\frac{1}{2}\sigma_H
\end{equation}

These hoop and longitudinal stresses are assumed to be the principal stresses $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$.
Thus the relationships from \eqref{eq:hoopStress} and \eqref{eq:sigmas} can be rearranged to yield a functional relationship between principal strain and internal pressure \eqref{eq:princStrainFin} \cite{b1}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:princStrainFin}
\varepsilon_1=\frac{Pr}{2Et}(2-\nu)
\end{equation}

\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Instrumenting the Soda Can}

The can must first be outfitted with the strain  gauge rosette.
First, the decorative wrapping on the beverage can is scrubbed off with methanol so that this wrapping does not affect the strain of the aluminum.
Once the surface is properly cleaned, painter's tape is used to create an approximately 90$^\circ$ L-shaped guideline towards the outer left and bottom edges of the cleaned surface for strain gauge placement.

To place the strain gauge rosette, clear packing tape is placed over the top of the rosette, opposite the side that will contact the surface of the can.
The tacky side of the taped strain rosette is then gently laid onto the can surface, such that the 0$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$ strain gauges are aligned with the taped guidelines.
When the placement of the strain rosette is properly aligned, part of the taped side is lifted, and glue is applied to the can.
The strain gauge rosette is replaced over top of the glue and allowed to cure.

\subsection{Wheatstone Bridge}

Each strain gauge works as a variable resistor in a Wheatstone bridge, whose voltage difference is recorded for the strain.
Three Wheatstone bridge configurations are wired onto a simple breadboard.
Each bridge also makes use of a pre-amplifier, as the voltages passing through the circuit are expected to be very small.
An excitation voltage of 3.3 V is wired so as to pass across each bridge from an external power supply.
This excitation voltage $V_s$ and the voltage difference $V_{amp}$ for each of the three bridges is recorded with a SADI DAQ device.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}

The SADI DAQ which records the voltage difference is fed into a LabVIEW virtual instrument.
The LabVIEW VI reads the $V_{amp}$ for each bridge as $V_{amp_{x}}$ for the 0$^\circ$ gauge, $V_{amp_{t}}$  for the 45$^\circ$ gauge, and $V_{amp_{y}}$ for the 90$^\circ$ gauge.
These are observed with a $\pm$5.12 V gain window.

\subsection{Ideal Gas Law Pressure Determination Method}

A secondary method is also used based upon the ideal gas law.
For this method, the temperature of the room is measured and the can is allowed to reach thermodynamic equilibrium with the room.
The unopened, instrumented can is weighed on the lab scale, and its initial weight is recorded.
After the can is opened, the instrumented can is weighed again to record its final weight.
Next, a bottle filled with an arbitrary amount of water is weighed on the lab scale.
Water is poured from the bottle into the open can until the headspace between the soda and the top of the can is filled.
The bottle is weighed again.

\section*{Appendix A: Uncertainty Calculation}

The uncertainty of each variable is given by Table \ref{tab:Uncertainty}.
The uncertainties in $V_{amp_{x}}$, $V_{amp_{t}}$, $V_{amp_{y}}$, and $V_{s}$ were calculated by finding the standard deviation of a large sample set of these measurements and approximating a 95\% confidence interval.
The uncertainties in $d$ and $t$ were determined from the measuring device used, which was a micrometer.
The uncertainties in the weights of the can and the water were determined from the scale that was used and analyzing the sensitivity of the last digit.
The uncertainties in $E$, $\nu$, $R$, $M$, and $\rho$ were estimated to be $\pm$1\% of the given value due to variability associated with these material properties \cite{b8}.

\subsection*{Uncertainty in $\Delta V_{amp}$}

The change in $V_{amp}$ for each strain gauge can be calculated using \eqref{eq:deltaVamp}, where $V_{amp_{xi}}$, $V_{amp_{\theta i}}$, and $V_{amp_{yi}}$ are the initial voltages and $V_{amp_{xf}}$, $V_{amp_{\theta f}}$, and $V_{amp_{yf}}$ are the final voltages.
